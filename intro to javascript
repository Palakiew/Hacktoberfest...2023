What is JavaScript?


JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.

JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
JavaScript Quickstart Tutorial

This tutorial will take a quick look at the most important JavaScript data types.

JavaScript variables can be:

    Numbers
    Strings
    Objects
    Arrays
    Functions
JavaScript Variables

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables:
Example
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
From the example above, you can expect:

    x stores the value 5
    y stores the value 6
    z stores the value 11

JavaScript Numbers

JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
Example
 var x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
var y = 3;       // A number without decimals

All numbers are stored as double precision floating point numbers.

The maximum number of decimals is 17, but floating point is not always 100% accurate:
Example
 var x = 0.2 + 0.1;         // x will be 0.30000000000000004

JavaScript Strings

Strings store text. Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
Example
var carname = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
var carname = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes 
The length of a string is found in the built in property length:
Example
var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
var sln = txt.length;
JavaScript Objects

You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
var car = "Fiat";
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. 
This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
JavaScript Arrays

JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
